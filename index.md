## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs


* Lab 3
Although this was one of the earliest labs we did, I still enjoyed it. One of the reasons was because at the time how difficult it was. Obviously if I were to try it now it would be easy but at the time I found it hard especially coming after lab 1 and 2. Thi lab made me realize how difficult and fun the class can be and it made me want to study more after.


* Lab 7
In this lab we were tasked with creating parking rules and what time and day cars can’t park there. This lab wasn't that easy but it wasn't that difficult which is why I considered it my favorite lab. Having to enter the numbers on what time and what day was fun for me.


* Lab 6 Part 1
Being able to create a game which was inspired after black jack was fun. I’ve played this game before so creating this on code was cool!
